        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Rebecca Yarros</p>
        <p>20-year old Violet Sorrengail is the youngest daughter of General Lilith Sorrengail, who leads the Basgiath War College in Navarre. Students can choose to join one of four military branches: Infantry, Healer, Scribe, or Rider. Rider's bond to a dragon which allows them to develop a magical power known as a signet. The kingdom is protected by wards that use dragon magic.

Despite having trained most of her life to be a scribe like her late father, and suffering from chronic pain and weak joints, Violet is ordered by her mother to join the Riders Quadrant, seemingly for the sake of her own reptation. Violet’s older sister, Mira, a dragon rider graduate, helps her prepare for conscription day by giving her a journal with survival tips from their deceased brother Brennan, a dragon rider who died in a rebellion, and an unbreakable corset made of dragon scales from her own dragon Teine. She also warns her to stay away from children of rebels, who are branded with relics and forced to enter the Rider Quadrant as punishment for their parents rebellion. As general Sorrengail was responsible for their execution, they may seek revenge on her family.

 Liam's dragon is killed, and he dies in Violet's arms, since riders will die if their bonded dragons do. Using her lightning powers, Violet defeats the last venin and briefly stops time with energy from Andarna, but she becomes seriously injured. Xaden and the survivors seek safety in Aretia, an abandoned city. After three days, Violet wakes up, and Xaden vows to earn her trust, though she remains cautious. She is shocked to find her brother Brennan alive and part of the revolution l, having used his mending signet to heal Violet's injuries.
