        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Colleen Hoover </p>
        <p>Struggling, reclusive author Lowen Ashleigh meets Jeremy, the charming, mysterious husband of bestselling author Verity Crawford, who is severely incapacitated following a car accident. He proposes that Lowen ghostwrite Verity’s novels. Lowen visits the Crawfords’ home.

Arriving at the remote, eerie lake house, Lowen meets the non-responsive and bedridden Verity. Sifting through Verity’s notes, Lowen finds a hidden, unpublished autobiography manuscript labeled "So Be It", in which Verity describes her obsessive love for Jeremy and jealousy toward their twin daughters, Chastin and Harper, whom she viewed as competition for his affection.

Verity's writing admits to faking affection for her children, and wishing for Harper’s death after Chastin’s death due to an allergic reaction. Verity also admits to witnessing Harper’s drowning without intervening. Lowen begins to believe that Verity may be dangerous and faking her condition.

Lowen starts falling for Jeremy, who appears emotionally broken and vulnerable. Jeremy supposedly reads the manuscript privately from Lowen; who overhears an outburst from Jeremy. Lowen sees Jeremy physically confronting Verity on the baby camera system. She joins Jeremy in an attempt to stop him from attacking Verity however Jeremy wordlessly expresses that they need to kill Verity so Lowen helps make it appear she died of natural causes.

Lowen becomes pregnant with Jeremy’s child. Beneath a floorboard, Lowen discovers a letter addressed to Jeremy. In it Verity claims the manuscript was an exercise to help her write from a villain's point of view. She insists that the actions described were entirely fictional and that she never harmed her children. She explains that she faked her paralysis after Jeremy’s violent behavior post-manuscript discovery made her fear for her life.

Lowen destroys the letter, deciding that the truth—whatever it may be—should remain buried. </p><br>
